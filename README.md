## What is this about?

This bash script is to provide a scoring system for Sarang's morning exercise on our backyard lawn.

The UI is whiptail and backend is done by manipulating JSON files using jq.

## Requirements
You need `whiptail` and `jq` and of course, run it on bash on a GNU/Linux system.

## Running
Simply execute `run.sh`.
