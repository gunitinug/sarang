# Sarang's story:
# Sarang is a 14 year old fox terrier. He is my dog. He injured his neck on
# an accident and he got paralyzed on all his limbs. Me and my family cared
# for Sarang for two months; he made a remarkable recovery. Now he is able
# to stand and walk, albeit wobbly at times.
#
# SARANG is a program to measure Sarang's progress when Sarang does his daily
# morning exercise on our backyward lawn. So I can track his progress (esp.
# how he walks) and hopefully move him out of the room (he is confined to mum's
# room except when he is out for his exercise). Fingers crossed.
